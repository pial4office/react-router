## Browser Router

A `<BrowserRouter>` stores the current location in the browser's address bar using clean URLs and
navigates using the browser's built-in history stack.

`<BrowserRouter window>` defaults to using the current document's defaultView,
but it may also be used to track changes to another window's URL, in an `<iframe>`
